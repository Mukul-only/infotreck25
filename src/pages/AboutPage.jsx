            meets imagination. Our mission is to bridge the gap between academia
            and the real world by encouraging students to engage with the latest
            trends in computer science, participate in hands-on events, and
            build meaningful connections. Whether you're a coder, designer,
            gamer, or performer—INFOTREK has something for you.

            INFOTREK has grown from a modest student-driven initiative into a
            major campus event known for its diverse blend of technical
            contests, workshops, cultural nights, and keynote talks. Over the
            years, we’ve hosted hundreds of participants, sparked countless
